### 🎵 Gesture & Voice Controlled Media Player
This project enables hands-free control of your media player (like Spotify) using hand gestures and voice commands. It's built using OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI, and Speech Recognition to recognize predefined gestures and voice actions like play, pause, next, previous, volume up/down, and mute.

### ⚙️ How to Use
1. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui SpeechRecognition pyaudio
2. **Run the code file**
3. **Setup phase**
Show a unique hand gesture for each action when prompted using your fingers. Use different fingers for different gestures because the gestures are stored in vector format eg:[0,0,0,0,0]
4. **Control phase**
Use gestures or speak commands like:
"play", "pause", "next", "volume down", "mute" etc

### 🔊 Voice & Gesture Tips
1. Speak one command at a time.
2. You can show your own custom gesture for each action during setup.
